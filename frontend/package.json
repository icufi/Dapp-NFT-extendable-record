  "description": "This react frontend allows users to connect their metamask wallet so that they may interact with their NFT, generate an image based on their NFT and mint a new NFT with on-chain metadata based on user inputs. It takes in user input including an NFT project name, token number, short message and keyword. After backend validation, the frontend displays an array of images generated by the nodejs server backend. The backend will prompt the user to purchase an 'in house' NFT if the connected user address does not already own one. The user can then mint a new Polygon NFT on our contract based on the images displayed and send an email if the mint completes.",
