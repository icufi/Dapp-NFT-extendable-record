  "description": "This is a backend Node/Express server. It writes/reads user data from a MongoDB database. It calls existing NFT contracts on Ethereum for NFT ownership and metadata.  It retrieves user owned NFT images from IPFS. It incorporates the retrieved NFT image into an existing template. User supplied data is also incorporated into the newly created SVG image.  It then returns an array of images to the frontend for user selection and NFT minting on Polygon.  If the user chooses to mint a returned image and if the owner of the original NFT is the user interacting with the frontend, this server hashes and pins the new image to IPFS using the Pinata API and mints an NFT with on-chain metadata that 'mirrors' the NFT minted by the user on the frontend. This server also runs a periodic script that checks the database against a Polygon NFT contract for failed 'mirror contract' mints then attempts to mint if the data is valid and NFT ownership current. This server also accepts and writes to the database user suggestions from the fontend. It sends emails based on user supplied data if a new NFT mint transaction is perfomed and valid ownership is confirmed on-chain. It runs a periodic script to send emails generated by users and saved on the database if a mint failure occurs but is subsequently completed by the mint interval script at a later time after the user has left the frontend.",
